<div class="heading1">Appendix E: Getting Involved</div>
openSUSE is developed in the open, and everybody can join in - this means that you can help to create and shape openSUSE. If you wish to participate actively in openSUSE or other free software projects, there are plenty of things to do. Finding something that matches your interests, available time and your skills should be no problem at all.<br /><br />

<div class="tip"><em>"I get the question of "Where should I start?" fairly often and my advice is just don't even ask that question. It's more like if you're not interested enough in one particular area that you already know what you want to try to do, don't do it. Just let it go and then when you hit something where you say, "I could do this better" and you actually feel motivated enough that you go from saying that to doing that, you will have answered that question yourself."</em> - <b>Linus Torvalds</b></div><br />



<div class="heading2">E.1 Get in Touch</div>
