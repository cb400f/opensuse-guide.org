## 1.1 About openSUSE Leap

openSUSE Leap is a PC operating system based on GNU and Linux. It's a free/open source and gratis alternative to e.g. Microsoft Windows with many advantages. openSUSE Leap is suitable for laptops, desktops, netbooks, servers and multimedia center PCs at home or in small offices. You can also run openSUSE on your [ARM](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:ARM) or [PPC](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:PowerPC) computer, but that is not covered by this guide.

openSUSE Leap is among the leading GNU/Linux distributions and is also one of the oldest existing ones. openSUSE Leap uses a core system from SUSE Linux Enterprise but with up-to-date hardware support, desktop environments and graphical applications. Every year a major service pack is released and every 3-4 years there is a major new release where also the core system will be upgraded.

For experienced and adventurous GNU/Linux users who want to take risks with their operating system and live on the bleeding edge, there is also a rolling release version of openSUSE available called [openSUSE Tumbleweed](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Tumbleweed).

openSUSE Leap is developed openly and transparently by community volunteers working together with SUSE employees.
