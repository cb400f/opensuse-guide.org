# 14. Graphics Drivers

Note that there's no need to install the below non-free video drivers, if the free drivers used by default work for your needs.

<!-- nvidia KMPs start -->

## 14.1 Nvidia

This section describes two different ways of installing the proprietary Nvidia graphics driver, either using 1-click installation or using the terminal.

### 15.1.1 Install the Nvidia Driver with 1-Click Installation

Click on the button corresponding to your Nvidia graphics card to install the driver with 1-click install.

<div class="tip">
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><img src="images/pics/tip.png" alt="tip" /></td>
<td>These 1-Click Installers currently only work with the <b>Firefox web browser</b>.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>

One click for <b>Geforce 600 series and later</b>. <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/Download/driverResults.aspx/145182/en-us" target="_blank">See supported products<a/>.

One click for <b>Geforce 400 series and later</b>. <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/Download/driverResults.aspx/142567/en-us" target="_blank">See supported products<a/>.

Afterwards reboot the computer.

### 14.1.2 Install the Nvidia Driver in the Terminal

You can install the Nvidia driver in the terminal. <u>By using this method you don't need to know your graphics card model or series</u>.

First add the repository:

<div class="clroot">zypper addrepo -f https://download.nvidia.com/opensuse/leap/15.3 nvidia</div>

The following command should automatically install the correct driver for your card:

<div class="clroot">zypper install-new-recommends --repo https://download.nvidia.com/opensuse/leap/15.3</div>

When installation is done reboot the computer.

<!-- nvidia KMP end -->
<!-- ati KMP start -->

## 14.2 ATI/AMD

The free software drivers included by default should work very well for most. For some newer cards you may need a proprietary driver, see:

<!-- ati KMP end -->

## 14.3 Intel

The 3D drivers for Intel graphics cards are free software, and can therefore be included in openSUSE out of the box. No additional installation or configuration is needed.
